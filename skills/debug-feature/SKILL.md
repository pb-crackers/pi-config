# Debug Feature

Do not edit product code, commit, or begin Build during this phase. Set the
Obsidian task record to `Status: debugging`. If none exists, create
`<project>/Tasks/<slug>.md`, link it from the feature index, or queue both
mutations in `OBSIDIAN_OUTBOX.md` when offline.

## Report

Ask only for missing information:

- What should happen?
- What happens instead?
- How can it be reproduced, if known?

## Investigate

1. Reproduce the bug when practical.
2. Trace the relevant flow directly. Use `scout` only when a broader independent
   trace should save time.
3. Use `researcher`, `oracle`, or `reviewer` only when an external behavior,
   competing explanation, or material risk needs resolution.
4. Do not claim a root cause without evidence.

## Record

Add or update this section in the task record:

```markdown
## Debug

### Report

### Root cause
- Symptom:
- Root cause:
- Evidence:

### Fix plan
- Smallest fix:
- Validation:
```

Keep the fix within the reported scope and include a check that proves the bug
is fixed. For UI bugs, include the required user-facing state and visual
validation.

## Approval gate

Present the root cause analysis and fix plan. Ask whether to approve it for
Build.

- On approval, set `Status: approved` and continue to `build-feature`.
- On requested changes or unresolved evidence, remain `debugging`.

Build owns implementation, review, fresh-build validation, and UAT handoff.
