# Ship Feature

Require an Obsidian task record with `Status: approved-to-ship`, `shipping`, or
`awaiting-merge` and recorded UAT approval. That approval grants the parent
shipping and merge authority; do not ask for either again.

1. Inspect the final diff and status; preserve unrelated work and confirm every
   approved criterion and visual state.
2. Set `Status: shipping`, commit only approved task files, and run every
   project-defined headless shipping command before each push, including any
   app-specific validation script named in project instructions. Do not open
   Device Hub merely to ship and never bypass a tracked hook.
3. When the gate passes, push and open the pull request without asking. Record
   the command, result, UAT approval, commits, and PR URL in the task record or
   outbox.
4. Wait for required remote checks. If none exist, the successful local gate is
   the build evidence. Never ignore a failed check without explicit approval.
5. If shipping uncovers a required code change, set `Status: building`, return
   to `build-feature`, and repeat UAT before shipping again.
6. When required checks pass, merge without asking. If checks are pending, wait;
   if the workflow must stop, set `Status: awaiting-merge` so a later invocation
   resumes here. Ask only when blocked. Release or deployment requires separate
   authority.
7. After merge, set `Status: done`, update the Obsidian feature index and shipped
   log, record completion evidence, and commit any remaining approved repository
   documentation through the same headless gate.

Report the branch, commits, PR, checks, merge status, approval evidence, and any
remaining risk. Never claim completion for an unapproved or blocked step.
